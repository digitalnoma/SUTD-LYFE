## WE THOUGHT IT THROUGH. <a name="introduction"></a>

Our project, SUTD LYFE has one aim – to streamline communications among SUTD undergraduate and graduate students as well as inbound exchange students . It is a platform to help students source for materials and obtain items more efficiently, creating a collaborative ecosystem in SUTD. 

SUTD LYFE is a multi-purpose android application that links SUTD students together via a modern, minimalistic interface that reduces clutter and allows for easy navigation. Students get to communicate their needs with one another on the platform. They can sell unwanted resources after a project is completed, or even purchase required items for their upcoming/current project(s). As SUTD students, there is often a lack of food options in school at night, coupled with the frequent food wastages from over-catered food. Lastly, the additional costs borne by university students, exacerbated student debts and rising costs of living. Hence SUTD LYFE is our solution to tackling the pain points felt by these students. 

As the focus is on speed and functionality, our design is relatively simple to use and navigate. Three taps can send a user request for an item to be purchased and can browse through local news readings. With about four to five button presses, the user can list their items on the platform, adding details about the product and the location for the exchange. 

There are four main features: Marketplace, Food, News and Weather. For our project, we focused mainly on the Marketplace, Food and News features, which were all impressive app-worthy features on their own. 

For the front-end, it was designed entirely in Java under Android Studio. reading resources were referenced from Android Developers Website. Most of the concepts taught in our infomation systems class could be applied to our project, together with mobile UI/UX design inspiration taken from Dribbble, a site that showcases the World’s Top Design Portfolios. Additional concepts that were not taught in class, such as Fragments, Navigation Controller and variants of RecyclerView were picked up from Youtube Tutorials and reading the best app development practices through articles such as Medium. 

For back-end, we referenced the documentation from Firebase, NewsAPI.org and Android Developers for our Realtime Database, NewsAPI endpoint setup and the Cloud Storage used to store and retrieve user details and images.

## AND WE BUILT IT. <a name="build"></a>

[comment]: <> (add marketplace image)

The Marketplace feature will provide a platform for users to buy, sell, and share second-hand goods and equipment with other users within the hostel community. 

This feature will be beneficial for students who are on a tight budget, as it will provide an affordable way to acquire necessary items.

To use this feature, users will be able to create posts and listings of the items they wish to sell, share or give away. The posts can include a description of the item, its condition, and the price (if applicable). Users will also be able to upload pictures of the item to give potential buyers a better idea of what they are purchasing.

The Food feature will be a unique addition to our app, aimed at reducing food wastage and fostering a sense of community among hostel residents. This feature will allow users to share leftover food that has been catered for events such as meetings, conferences, or parties. Users will be able to post information about the food they have available, including the type of food, quantity, and location for pick-up.

In addition, the Food feature will also allow users to post a group food order. This will be useful for students who may not want to bear the cost of delivery prices alone, but still want to order food for their meals. By sharing the food delivery order, they can split the cost of delivery and share it among those who are ordering together.

## THE DAILY SG KETCHUP. <a name="news"></a>


[comment]: <> (add news image)

As for our Newsletter feature, we believe that all University students should have an all in one place to consume the news. In today’s day and age, it is increasingly important to read widely as it not only broadens our world view but also gives us the ability to critique a range of issues to make better decisions that will shape our future. Hence we would like to empower SUTD Students to be more initiative by providing them an easy to access, subscription-less and intuitive news service that will change the way we interact with the app on a daily basis.

## SO WHERE ARE WE HEADED? <a name="future"></a>

Future developments include upgrading to the user interface as we strongly believe that ultimately, first impression plays a massive impact on the user. By ensuring that the design is aesthetically pleasing to the eye and is convenient to users, more students will be more engaged and inclined to use the application. 

For the marketplace, we could add categories. Filtering, sorting, and search buttons. We could even consider deleting or auto-deleting listings that have ‘expired’ after a set period of time. 

For other aspects of the app, we can also implement statistics of facilities. For example, the number of people in the library, which rooms are being used, number of people in the gym, booking of facilities, carpark status(es), and many more. This metric can be gathered quite accurately, although not perfect. This is because SUTD facilities mainly require student cards, and therefore this can play into our idea nicely. 


## CONCLUSION <a name="end"></a>
The project was a very good exposure into software development. There was a lot of learning of syntax and how to use Android Studio. For the project, there was a clear importance in reading up documentation in using certain methods or classes or libraries in order to achieve what we wanted. This was very evident especially when learning the back-end database in Firebase; how to interact with Firebase; how to interact between the front-end and back-end, and the widgets themselves. 

#### AND HENCE WE BOLDLY DELIVERED.
